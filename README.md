# mrjavaguy dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

based on https://github.com/DanielThomas/oh-your-dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file

## Install

Run this:

initial setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/haacked/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
dotfiles_install
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
